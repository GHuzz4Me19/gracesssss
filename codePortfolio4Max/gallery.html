                <img src="images/reddress.jpg">
                <p> I made this back when I was first starting to practice drawing digital silk (5 years ago?). It was lots of fun to make and visualize where the light would hot the dress and where the shadows would be placed. I wasnt very good with backrounds or skin but it was a work in progress back then.</p>

                <img src="images/pinkhair.png">
                <p> This was inspired by Demon Slayer, an anime I watched back in covid. I was testing around with drawing anime hair and backrounds. </p>

                <h3>Japanese Shrine</h3>
                <img src="images/ceramics.jpg">
                <p>The ceramics peice I constructed in highschool for my grade 11 final assignment. I wanted to do somthing bigger then normal but made it very difficult for the kiln to process. it can 1) either come out completely fine. 2) crack and break. or 3) most commonly with peices this big it can expload and break all the other peices in it. It actually cracked in the kilnl becuasse it was too big. but my teacher trusted me to do sucha big peice but there was a lot of presure on me not to destroy the peices people had been working on for the whole semester.... before the kiln you have to let it dry enough to the point its completely solid after sculpting. a trick is to put it in the same room as the kiln to make it dry faster. but if it dries too fast it can crack that way too.</p>

                <img src="images/preceramics.jpg">
                <p>This was what I made in grade 12. I wasnt too pleased with this peice since It was more somthing to practice texture with that I just heppened to make into a peice. I didnt have the final picture on my phone so this was all i could show.</p>

                <img src="images/paintingwater.jpg">
                <p>  I remember when i was applying for carleton I needed more projects to show my creative ability. So in order to show my creative ability, i decided to paint somthing to show efficentsy and skill.</p>

                <h3>Rock Painting</h3>
                <img src="images/rock.jpg">
                <p> This one made me take layering into perspective. I had to start with the backround since when I draw I noramlly start with the main event. In this case that would be the trees in the front. Its not too interesting but was quite eye opening in my art history to where I am tofay.</p>
