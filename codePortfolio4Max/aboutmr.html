                <img src="images/reddress.jpg">
                <p> I made this back when I was first starting to practice drawing digital silk (5 years ago?). It was lots of fun to make and visualize where the light would hot the dress and where the shadows would be placed. I wasnt very good with backrounds or skin but it was a work in progress back then.</p>

                <img src="images/tori-gate.avif">
                <p>A torii is a traditional Japanese gate most commonly found at the entrance of or within a Shinto shrine, where it symbolically marks the transition from the mundane to the sacred, and a spot where kami are welcomed and thought to travel through. They are well known for their speritual protection.<br>(this is an image of a gate set on the serface of the water as if it looks like a dorway to another sperit relm)</p>

                <img src="images/shinto-shrine.jpg">
                <p>Shinto shrines are places of worship and the dwellings of the kami, the Shinto "gods". Sacred objects of worship that represent the kami are stored in the innermost chamber of the shrine where they cannot usually be seen by anybody. <br> (this image is a line of shrines one after the other close together)</p>

                <h3>Traditional Kimono</h3>
                <img src="images/kimono.jpg">
                <p>Derived from the words ki (“wear”) and mono (“thing”), the kimono is a traditional Japanese garment. Kimonos come in a range of styles and patterns. They are typically hand-sewn into a “T” shape from four single pieces of fabric called tans and tied with an obi, or belt.<br>(this image is a women wearing a read kimono)</p>

                <img src="images/toshogu-shrine.jpg">
                <p> Toshogu Shrine is a magnificent memorial to Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, which ruled Japan for over 250 years until 1868. Ieyasu is enshrined at Toshogu as the deity Tosho Daigongen, "Great Deity of the East Shining Light" The lavishly decorated shrine complex consists of more than a dozen buildings set in a beautiful forest. Countless wood carvings and large amounts of gold leaf were used to decorate the buildings in a way not seen elsewhere in Japan, where simplicity has been traditionally stressed in shrine architecture. <br>(image of a shrine where people go and pray to the god for luck, traditionally in or near forests)</p>

                <img src="images/fugi-montain.webp">
                <p> Mount Fuji is with 3776 meters Japan's highest mountain. It is not surprising that the nearly perfectly shaped volcano has been worshiped as a sacred mountain and experienced big popularity among artists and common people throughout the centuries. Mount Fuji is an active volcano, which most recently erupted in 1707. It stands on the border between Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures and can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama on clear days. <br> (mont fuji in the image from a far way view)</p>

                <img src="images/arashiyama-bamboo.jpg">
                <p> Winter in Japan is generally cold, with snow in many places across the country. While it rarely snows in most of the metropolitan areas, the surrounding mountains and northern regions are regularly covered by fresh blankets of powder. The weather is usually sunny with low humidity. Winter in Japan brings a unique beauty to the scenery and offers a myriad of fun activities and delicious dishes. <br> (image is a bamboo forist where theres a path to walk, all the bamboo stafs are coverd with a small laye4r of snow)</p>
