                        The ceramics peice I constructed in highschool for my grade 11 final assignment. I wanted to do somthing bigger then normal but made it very difficult for the kiln to process. it can 1) either come out completely fine. 2) crack and break. or 3) most commonly with peices this big it can expload and break all the other peices in it. It actually cracked in the kilnl becuasse it was too big. but my teacher trusted me to do sucha big peice but there was a lot of presure on me not to destroy the peices people had been working on for the whole semester.... before the kiln you have to let it dry enough to the point its completely solid after sculpting. a trick is to put it in the same room as the kiln to make it dry faster. but if it dries too fast it can crack that way too.

                        This was what I made in grade 12. I wasnt too pleased with this peice since It was more somthing to practice texture with that I just heppened to make into a peice. I didnt have the final picture on my phone so this was all i could show.

                        This one made me take layering into perspective. I had to start with the backround since when I draw I noramlly start with the main event. In this case that would be the trees in the front. Its not too interesting but was quite eye opening in my art history to where I am tofay.
